# Decisions Ledger — Spec v0.6

The ledger is the **single source of truth** that the skill's three surfaces (map/wiki, interview, brainstorm) read and write. None of the three holds state of its own: they all project a view over the ledger. This is what stops three agents talking about the same problem from diverging — i.e. the exact failure mode the skill cures in codebases.

On-disk form: one `ledger.json` in the audit's output directory (portable, git-versionable). Maps 1:1 onto Postgres tables if application-level persistence is needed.

**New in v0.2:** the `Pin` object is now a **strict discriminated union on `kind`** (shared envelope + a `kind`-specific `as_is`/`to_be`/`question` payload), with an open `other` variant as an escape hatch. `DecisionEvent` gains `flip_criteria`.

---

## Entities

- **`Pin`** — the atomic unit: a delta between `as_is` (how it is now) and `to_be` (how it should be), or an ambiguity to resolve before the to-be can even be defined. It is the object pinned on the map and the pivot of an interview question.
- **`Question`** — lives ON the pin. The interview is not a separate list: it is the filtered view of pins in state `needs_input`.
- **`Proposal`** — output of the brainstorm; it writes proposals with tradeoffs, never decides.
- **`DecisionEvent`** — append-only, immutable log of the *why*; now with `flip_criteria`.
- **`RemediationItem`** — the bridge to Phase 4; records the ponytail ladder rung.

---

## The 9 design decisions that carry the weight

1. **`anchors` is a cross-layer LIST**, not a single pointer. A mismatch is multi-node (a DB column *and* an API field *and* a frontend use). It rests on the knowledge graph's node IDs; each anchor carries a `role` that tells the UI how to render it.
2. **`kind` is a discriminator** that constrains the shape of `as_is`/`to_be`/`question`. A strict union for the known kinds + an open `other`.
3. **The question lives on the pin; the interview is a view** (`state == needs_input`).
4. **The brainstorm writes `proposals[]`, never `decision`.** Neutrality enforced by the schema.
5. **`decision_log` immutable, `pin.state` materialized.** Reconciliation rule: last committed decision wins on state, history preserved.
6. **`depends_on` generates the sequenced roadmap.** "Contracts before logic" falls out of the dependency graph, it is not hardcoded.
7. **`to_be` is DERIVED from decisions, not hand-written.** Roadmap = diff(to_be, as_is).
8. **The ponytail rung is recorded on proposals AND remediation.** Auditable minimalism.
9. **Every decision carries a `flip_criteria`** (idea from agentic-engineering): the observable condition under which the elected truth must be reopened. Stops a decision made on incomplete info from fossilizing.

## Variants discriminated by `kind`

### `contract_mismatch` — cross-layer disagreement (verifiable)
```jsonc
"as_is": {                       // maps layer → observed shape
  "db": "role ENUM('admin','user')",
  "api": "role: string",
  "frontend": "role === 'superadmin'",
  "disagreeing_layers": ["frontend"]
},
"to_be": { "shape": "ENUM('admin','user')", "canonical_layer": "db" },
"question": {
  "prompt": "The frontend uses 'superadmin', absent from the DB. What is the intended role set?",
  "options": [                   // candidate-truths derived from the divergent shapes
    { "id": "opt_a", "label": "Only {admin,user} — DB is truth", "implication": "remove the FE check" },
    { "id": "opt_b", "label": "Add superadmin to the schema", "implication": "migration + enum everywhere" }
  ],
  "allow_freeform": true
}
```

### `internal_contradiction` — disagreement within ONE layer (e.g. two auth flows)
```jsonc
"as_is": {
  "variants": [
    { "desc": "JWT on /api/v1", "anchor_ref": "n_501" },
    { "desc": "session cookie on /api/v2", "anchor_ref": "n_777" }
  ]
},
"to_be": { "elected": "n_501", "rationale_ref": "ev_..." },
"question": { "prompt": "...", "options": [ /* the variants as candidates */ ], "allow_freeform": true }
```

### `ambiguity` — multiple truths, must be elected BEFORE the to-be can be defined
```jsonc
"severity": "blocker",           // typically blocks defining the to-be
"as_is": {
  "candidates": [                // no "current": genuinely undecided
    { "interpretation": "orders is in v1 scope", "evidence_ref": "n_...", "confidence": "inferred" },
    { "interpretation": "orders is a future feature", "evidence_ref": "n_..." }
  ]
},
"to_be": { "elected_interpretation": "string" },
"question": { "prompt": "...", "options": [ /* the interpretations */ ], "allow_freeform": true }
```

### `incompleteness` — stub/unfinished: a WORK ITEM, not a defect
```jsonc
"as_is": {
  "present": "route POST /orders defined",
  "missing": "handler body is `pass` / stub",
  "is_intentional_stub": true    // distinguishes from a defect — do not render as an error
},
"to_be": { "behavior_spec": "string (what it must do once complete)" },
"question": {
  "prompt": "Is orders in scope for v1?",
  "options": [
    { "id": "impl", "label": "Implement now" },
    { "id": "defer", "label": "Defer (deferred)" },
    { "id": "drop", "label": "Not needed — remove (YAGNI)" }
  ],
  "allow_freeform": true
}
```

### `design_concern` — an improvable choice: JUDGMENT, not a finding
```jsonc
"as_is": {
  "current_design": "string (description)",
  "concern": "string (why it is suboptimal)"
},
"to_be": null,                   // stays null until decided — it is an OPTION, not a defect
"question": {
  "prompt": "...",
  "options": [                   // often fed by the brainstorm's proposals
    { "id": "keep", "label": "Leave as-is (accepted)" },
    { "id": "prop_1", "label": "Alternative A", "proposal_ref": "prop_1" }
  ],
  "allow_freeform": true
}
// legitimate default resolution: state = "accepted"
```

### `defect` — bug/security/dead-code/duplication: verifiable, often without an interview
```jsonc
"as_is": {
  "description": "SQL injection via string concat",
  "evidence": { "tool": "semgrep", "rule_id": "python.sqli.raw", "loc": "..." }
},
"to_be": { "corrected": "use a parameterized query" },
"question": null,                // usually no question: goes straight to remediation (still gated by the plan)
```

### `other` — open escape hatch (honors "not just a few types")
```jsonc
"kind_detail": "string (what it is)",
"as_is": { },                    // free-form
"to_be": null
```

---

## `Proposal`, `DecisionEvent`, `RemediationItem`

```jsonc
// Proposal (inside pin.brainstorm.proposals[]) — DECISION 4
{ "id": "prop_1", "summary": "string",
  "tradeoffs": { "pros": ["..."], "cons": ["..."] },
  "ladder_rung": 3, "references": ["..."], "effort": "S" }   // S | M | L

// DecisionEvent (inside decision_log[]) — DECISIONS 5 and 9, immutable
{ "id": "ev_0007", "pin_id": "pin_0001", "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "outcome": "opt_a",            // option id | freeform
  "rationale": "string",
  "flip_criteria": "if users appear with permissions beyond admin, reopen",  // DECISION 9
  "source": "interview" }        // only "interview" commits

// RemediationItem (inside pin.remediation[]) — DECISION 8
{ "id": "rem_0001",
  "action": "align",             // consolidate | implement | refactor | delete | align
  "ladder_rung": 2,
  "canonical_target": "db",      // for consolidate/align: which copy is the truth
  "status": "todo" }             // todo | in_progress | done
```

## Lifecycle

```
detected ──(generates question)──▶ needs_input ──(opens brainstorm)──▶ brainstorming
                                     │                                   │
                                     │◀────────(proposals written)───────┘
                                     │
                          (user commits in interview)
                                     ▼
                                  decided ──(spawn remediation)──▶ resolved
                                     │
                              (or deferred / accepted)
```

`brainstorming` is transient/optional. `deferred` = out of scope now (YAGNI at the spec level). `accepted` = acknowledged, intentionally left as-is (the legitimate outcome of a `design_concern`).

---

## Ponytail amendment for slop (rung 2)

> **2. Already in the codebase (maybe duplicated)? → consolidate onto ONE canonical copy, don't add an (N+1)-th.**

For this, `RemediationItem` has `action: "consolidate"` and `canonical_target`: the fix records which copy becomes the truth and that the others converge onto it.

---

## v0.3 — Clustering, Policy, resolution_mode (question compression)

The problem: **200 findings are not 200 decisions.** 200 SQL injections are ONE decision; 15 divergent copies of a helper are ONE decision. v0.3 adds the funnel that compresses the questions.

### `cluster_id` on the `Pin`
Pins that share a decision (same kind of mismatch, same duplicated helper, same vuln class) carry the same `cluster_id`. The interview asks **once per cluster** and applies to the group. It is variant-analysis used to dedupe the *questions*, not just the patterns.

### `resolution_mode` on the `Pin`
- `asked` — a real question (ambiguity, design_concern, blocker)
- `policy_default` — resolved by a user-set Policy (passive review)
- `proposed_default` — a low-confidence long-tail guess (skim in bulk, override by exception)

### New entity `Policy`
A category rule the user sets in the interview that auto-resolves matching pins.
```jsonc
{ "id": "pol_schema_truth",
  "applies_to": { "kind": "contract_mismatch" },
  "rule": "DB is the source of truth by default",
  "default_outcome": { "canonical_layer": "db" },
  "set_by": "interview",
  "exceptions": ["pin_0042"] }        // excluded pins that stay `asked`
```
When a Policy cascades over a pin it generates a `DecisionEvent` with `source: "policy:<id>"` pointing back to the user's choice: it stays a **user-originated** decision, only amplified. Neutrality holds (the brainstorm still commits nothing).

### Threshold rule (confirmed)
What may end up in a silent default without disturbing anyone:
- `severity: blocker | high` → **never** silent. Always `asked`, or at least at the top of the batch to review.
- `severity: medium | low` → may go to `proposed_default`.

Volume collapses but nothing important slips away passively.

### The full funnel
```
200 pins → ~20 clusters → ~5 policies → ~10 real questions (asked)
         → the rest in proposed_default, skimmable in bulk
```
Order the `asked` questions by **information gain**: first the ones that, once answered, collapse the most downstream pins. The first ~10 do 90% of the work.

---

## v0.4 — Greenfield extension (twin skill `greenfield-forge`)

The ledger is **shared** by the repo's two sibling skills. `codebase-rescue` is curative (starts from as-is, derives the to-be backward); `greenfield-forge` is preventive (elects the to-be *first*, as-is grows until it coincides). Same schema, same anti-divergence property. A forged project carries its own `ledger.json`: it is the **audit baseline** rescue can later diff against the real code — closing the loop rescue cannot close on slop (whose docs are stale/aspirational; a forged ledger is not).

v0.4 adds, **additively** (no change to the existing variants):
- a new `Pin` `kind`: **`open_decision`** — the design fork not yet built;
- a new entity **`BuildItem`** — the twin of `RemediationItem` for construction.

### New `kind`: `open_decision` — design fork (greenfield)

Unlike `design_concern` (suboptimal **existing** code) and `incompleteness` (a stub inside code that exists), `open_decision` concerns a choice that **precedes** the code: nothing is built yet. `as_is` is null (or carries only the *givens* from the brief); `to_be` is derived from the election in the interview; the `question` is the fork with options and downstream implications.

```jsonc
"kind": "open_decision",
"severity": "high",              // for downstream fan-out: high if many decisions depend on it
"as_is": {
  "givens": ["must run on-prem", "the team knows Postgres"],  // constraints from the brief, not implementation
  "built": null                  // nothing yet — not a defect, it is the starting point
},
"to_be": null,                   // derived from the election (Decision 7) — never hand-written
"question": {
  "prompt": "Persistence model for v1?",
  "options": [
    { "id": "opt_pg",  "label": "Relational Postgres (single datastore)", "implication": "schema-first; contract = shared-types" },
    { "id": "opt_doc", "label": "Document store",                          "implication": "flexible schema; runtime validation" }
  ],
  "allow_freeform": true
},
"depends_on": [],                // wired by the decision-catalog: e.g. 'API style' depends_on 'data model'
"cluster_id": "cl_persistence"   // related forks resolved by a single policy
```

Lifecycle identical to the other pins: `detected → needs_input → (brainstorming) → decided → resolved`. Once `decided`, Phase 3 does not compute a reconciliation diff but **generates** the `BuildItem`s that realize the elected `to_be` (as-is grows until it coincides). `deferred` = out of v1 scope (stays future backlog, the natural hook into `slice` mode); `accepted` does not apply (there is no existing design to leave as-is).

Threshold rule unchanged: a high-fan-out `open_decision` (many inbound `depends_on`) is typically `high`/`blocker` → **always `asked`**, never a silent default — letting the model silently fill an undecided fork is the seed of slop. Tail forks (naming, style details) may go to `proposed_default`.

### New entity: `BuildItem` — the greenfield twin of `RemediationItem`

Where `RemediationItem` closes a gap on existing code, `BuildItem` **builds** what a decision committed to. Same discipline (ponytail rung recorded, bare minimum), different verbs. It lives in the same `pin.remediation[]` container.

```jsonc
{ "id": "bld_0001",
  "action": "scaffold",          // scaffold | implement | wire | configure
  "build_track": "A",            // A = red→green from the elected to_be (primary) · B = characterization (only when extending)
  "ladder_rung": 7,              // YAGNI for construction: never build beyond what the decision requires
  "contract_carrier": "shared-types",  // for 'scaffold' of the contract: the single source the layers are generated from
  "depends_on": ["bld_0000"],    // the DAG: client depends_on API depends_on contract
  "status": "todo" }             // todo | in_progress | done
```

`action`:
- **`scaffold`** — generate from a single source: the contract → DDL/ORM/DTO/client types aligned *by construction*; or the paved road (test harness, linter, CI, session-start hook).
- **`implement`** — realize the behavior of a vertical slice (Track A: red test from the `to_be`, then the minimum that makes it pass).
- **`wire`** — connect already-scaffolded pieces (a route to its handler, a form to its endpoint).
- **`configure`** — deterministic settings descending from a decision (env, secrets, feature flags).

The waves fall out of `depends_on` (contract & data model → paved road → core slice → secondary features → polish), they are not hardcoded — exactly like rescue's reconciliation waves. The diff `gap = diff(to_be, as_is)` stays the invariant: here `as_is` starts empty and the roadmap is the build backlog, which tends to zero at completed v1.

---

## v0.5 — Full loop: outcome, observable feedback, release & operate

v0.5 closes the lifecycle loop. It adds the **root** upstream of the decisions (the acceptance criteria) and the **return arc** from production (the observable `flip_criteria` that reopen pins). All additive: no existing variant changes.

### New `kind`: `acceptance_criterion` — the testable outcome that roots the DAG

Until now the chain was `decision → contract → test`. The zeroth rung was missing: `outcome → decision`. An `acceptance_criterion` is a **user-observable** and **testable** result from which the decisions descend. It roots the DAG: the architecture `open_decision`s `depends_on` the criteria they serve to satisfy, and the Track-A tests reference them.

```jsonc
"kind": "acceptance_criterion",
"severity": "high",
"as_is": { "built": null },
"to_be": {                        // the outcome, in testable form (Given/When/Then or equivalent)
  "statement": "a user can book a free slot and receives a confirmation",
  "verify": "e2e: POST /bookings on a free slot → 201 + confirmation event"
},
"question": {                     // bounded, NOT 'tell me about the app': is it in v1 scope?
  "prompt": "Is self-service booking a v1 outcome?",
  "options": [
    { "id": "in",  "label": "Yes, in v1 scope" },
    { "id": "def", "label": "Defer (deferred)" }
  ],
  "allow_freeform": true
},
"depends_on": []                  // outcomes are roots: nothing depends upstream of them
```

Acceptance criteria are the **engineering half** of requirements (problem statement + testable outcomes), not product management (user research, personas) — which stays out of scope. Anti-slop rule unchanged: an undeclared outcome is not silently assumed; it is elicited as a bounded fork or stays out. Security decisions from the threat model (STRIDE) are `open_decision`s with `provenance: "threat-model"` — no new kind is needed.

### Observable `flip_criteria` + `ReopenEvent` — the return arc

Until now `flip_criteria` was prose ("reopen if a module needs independent scaling"). To close the loop we make it **evaluable** against telemetry, in optional structured form alongside the prose:

```jsonc
// inside a DecisionEvent, next to the prose flip_criteria:
"flip_signal": {
  "signal": "module:orders p95_latency",
  "comparator": ">",
  "threshold": "200ms",
  "window": "sustained 7d",
  "source": "metrics"            // metrics | logs | traces | manual_checkpoint | incident
}
```

When the signal fires, the Operate&Evolve phase emits an immutable `ReopenEvent` and moves the dependent pins back to `needs_input` (state `reopened`). The arc **does not decide** — it only reopens, then hands back to the interview (`slice`) or to rescue. Neutrality holds as it does for the brainstorm.

```jsonc
// ReopenEvent (inside decision_log[]) — immutable
{ "id": "rev_0003", "pin_id": "pin_0001", "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "reason": "flip_signal fired: orders p95 340ms > 200ms for 9d",
  "fired": "flip_signal",
  "source": "feedback:metrics" }   // originated from production, not the user
```

A `flip_signal` without telemetry degrades to `manual_checkpoint`: a "did X happen?" question at a wave boundary or interval, never a hard-fail.

### `BuildItem` for Release and Operate

Phases 6 (Release) and 7 (Operate) introduce no new entities: they are `BuildItem`s with an extended `action`, and their pins are `open_decision` / `configure`.

```jsonc
"action": "instrument"           // + the existing scaffold | implement | wire | configure
// release:  migrations = implement (expand/contract) · deploy/flag/versioning = configure · rollback = procedure
// operate:  instrumentation (logs/metrics/traces/health) = instrument · SLO + signal manifest = configure
```

The **signal manifest** produced in Operate is what the `flip_signal`s watch: it is the physical anchor of the feedback arc. Without instrumentation the arc has no input — which is why Operate's codebase slice is a **precondition** of Evolve, not an extra.

---

## v0.6 — Oracle challenge (adversarial arc *upstream*)

Until now the elected truth was treated as correct until proven otherwise **by production**: `flip_signal`/`ReopenEvent` reopen it only when *reality changes* (downstream arc), and the wave-checkpoint doubts it only *during* the build. The **upstream** arc was missing: what if the oracle — an `acceptance_criterion`, the elected `to_be`, a `Policy` — is wrong *from the start*, before anything is built on it? A frozen wrong oracle is **worse** than no oracle: it scales its own wrongness and wears the authority of a green check. v0.6 adds the role and event that **challenge the oracle** adversarially, right after the interview and at every wave. Additive: no existing variant changes.

### `ChallengeEvent` — the neutral challenge that can reopen a pin

A read-only `challenger` (role defined in the agents doctrine, the adversarial twin of the `reviewer`: the reviewer *enforces* the oracle, the challenger *doubts* it) examines the `decided` pins and their `to_be`/criteria and actively tries to **refute** them. Like the brainstorm and the feedback loop it is **neutral: it challenges, it does not decide.** It emits an immutable `ChallengeEvent`; if the challenge survives the threshold review, it moves the pin back to `needs_input` (sub-state `challenged`, the twin of `reopened`) and hands it back to the interview — which stays the only thing that commits.

```jsonc
// ChallengeEvent (inside decision_log[]) — immutable, neutral
{ "id": "chl_0002", "pin_id": "pin_0007", "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "target": "acceptance_criterion",  // acceptance_criterion | to_be | policy | decision
  "class": "unfalsifiable",          // unfalsifiable | inconsistent | unsatisfiable | unstated_assumption | ignored_fanout | other
  "argument": "the criterion 'the app is fast' has no testable verify: no test can fail it",
  "severity": "high",                // same threshold as pins: high/blocker → always re-asked, never a default
  "upheld": true,                    // outcome of the threshold review; true → reopens
  "source": "challenge:challenger" } // originated from the agent, never commits
```

The **challenge classes** (the `class`) are the typical ways an oracle is wrong upstream, not a closed taxonomy (`other` stays the escape hatch):
- `unfalsifiable` — the `to_be`/criterion has no `verify` that could fail (no test can refute it) → it is not an oracle, it is a slogan.
- `inconsistent` — two mutually incoherent criteria/decisions (satisfying one violates the other).
- `unsatisfiable` — the `to_be` is not realizable from the known `givens`/constraints (an impossible commitment).
- `unstated_assumption` — the decision rests on an assumption never declared (see `provenance: agent_assumption` below): reopen it by making it explicit.
- `ignored_fanout` — a high-fan-out `open_decision`/criterion resolved as if it were not one (a silent default where `asked` was needed).

Neutrality rule (enforced as for brainstorm/feedback-loop): the challenger writes **only** `ChallengeEvent`s and, if `upheld`, moves the pin to `needs_input`. It does not write a `DecisionEvent`, does not elect, does not edit code. Identical threshold: a sustained `high`/`blocker` challenge is **always** `asked` again, never a silent default. **Reopens the minimum** — the challenged pin plus only the dependents that rested on the falsified oracle (via `depends_on`), exactly like the feedback loop. A challenger that reopens everything regenerates the very churn the skills cure.

### `provenance: agent_assumption` — the forced assumption made vetoable

Precondition of the challenge, and an anti-slop rule in its own right: when an agent **must** assume to proceed on under-specified input, it does not encode the assumption silently — it materializes it as a pin (or as a `provenance` entry on the pin it is creating) with `confidence: inferred|ambiguous` and `provenance: [{ "source": "agent_assumption", "detail": "..." }]`. This makes the assumption **visible** on the map, **vetoable** in the interview, and **challengeable** by the challenger (class `unstated_assumption`) — instead of becoming a mute decision. It is the schema-level translation of the principle "on vague input, raise the effort by surfacing the gaps, not by guessing confidently". The surface-level doctrine lives in the assumptions doc; only the data form lives here.

### Why this is the missing arc

The feedback loop closes the loop *downstream* (production falsifies the decision → reopen). The challenger closes the loop *upstream* (the oracle is incoherent/untestable/unsatisfiable → reopen **before** building). Together they cover the two ways an elected truth can be wrong: wrong *become* (reality changed) and wrong *born*. Both arcs **reopen and do not decide** — neutrality is the same anti-divergence property that holds the whole ledger together.
